Hero Today, Gone Tomorrow! 

                A MySQL database driven web app created for citizens to report sightings of superheroes.
                Various information is tracked including lists of organizations (i.e., Avengers),
                superpowers, locations, headquarters, and more. The app is a full fledged CRUD system
                that allows users to create, edit and update a carefully built database.

                Data was originally generated by hand research, and a vast 2000+ data point collection
                of sightings and locations was generated randomly. All locations are real world coordinates,
                and the home screen shows the geo-location of the most recent sightings.
               
                The app was built using Spring-boot and runs as a standalone servlet REST controller. The
                front end is completely de-coupled, and runs as a plain website on a tomcat server. Communiction
                flows between the front end, REST controller, and database quickly and smoothly. Since the app
                was built with this flexible design in mind, the option for a mobile front end is plausible.
